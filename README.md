A simple note and todo app written in python

Keybinds: Ctrl-w: Quit | Ctrl-s: Save | Ctrl-f: Search | Return: Save | Alt-Return: New Line | Alt-t: Toggle Mode

Toggle mode switches between notes mode and todo mode. Todo mode presents your whole todo file and can be edited and saved
Notes mode just creates a file named for the date, puts my cool unicorn Steve at the top, and then starts appending notes with time stamps
Thats it, nothing fancy
